# UI Engineer Coding Assessment

### Using the mock-ups provided, build a mobile first list component as follows:

Do your best to complete as many steps as you can.

- [x] 1. Using only HTML, create a template for the structure depicted in the mock-ups.
- [x] 2. Using CSS, style your template so it matches the mock-ups as closely as possible.
- [x] 3. Create an Angular list component from your code and import it to the project.
- [x] 4. Display system's current date in the format shown in the mock-ups.
- [x] 5. Display the total number of items in the list header. (I did this on load - does not update when you add a new item via the "+" icon)
- [ ] 6. Display the total number of new items as red badge in the list header.
- [x] 7. Display default image placeholder if item is missing icon.

### BONUS:

- [x] - Add collapse functionality to the list component.
- [x] - Configure the component so it loads hardcoded data object.
- [ ] - Create functions for Add and Delete buttons. (Created functionality that adds an object to the array when a user clicks the "+" icon)
- [x] - Truncate long texts in list items. 

### Component behavior:

- [x] - New items are indicated by blue border. (Styles added (by adding the class `.new`), logic was not)
- [x] - List components can be collapsed by clicking the caret icon. 
- [ ] - The entire list item including the icon is clickable to open the record.
- [x] - The component must be responsive.
- [x] - List item icons are hidden in mobile view.
